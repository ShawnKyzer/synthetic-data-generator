# synthetic-data-generator
We will create a machine learning pipeline to generate time series and other types of datasets using GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) and LSTM models from custom sample data.



## Getting started

1. Install Anaconda 
   * Installation instructions by environment https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

    ```conda env create -f environment.yml```

3. Change into the main pipeline directory

    ```cd synthetic-data-pipeline```

4. Install the dependencies 

    ```pip install -r src/requirements.txt```
